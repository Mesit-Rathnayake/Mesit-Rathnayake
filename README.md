## Languages & Tools (with icons and percentages)

The list below shows a visual-style breakdown of top languages (icons + percentages). Replace icons if you prefer other sources — the links below use popular icon assets.

| Language | Icon | Percentage |
|---|---:|---:|
| JavaScript | <img alt="JavaScript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" width="20" height="20"> | 64.23% |
| C# | <img alt="C#" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/csharp/csharp-original.svg" width="20" height="20"> | 9.84% |
| HTML | <img alt="HTML5" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/html5/html5-original.svg" width="20" height="20"> | 7.94% |
| Jupyter Notebook | <img alt="Jupyter" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PKief/vscode-material-icon-theme/main/icons/jupyter.svg" width="20" height="20"> | 7.25% |
| CSS | <img alt="CSS3" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/css3/css3-original.svg" width="20" height="20"> | 6.91% |
| Dart | <img alt="Dart" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/dart/dart-original.svg" width="20" height="20"> | 3.84% |

Notes:
- Percentages above follow the values shown in your reference image. If you want these computed from your repos instead of hard-coded, I can switch the "Top Langs" widget to a static QuickChart pie/donut generated from the live percentages (or you can provide updated percentages).
- If any icon above does not render for you, you can host a small PNG/SVG in one of your repos (for example /assets/lang/javascript.svg) and point the image src to that URL.
